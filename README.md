Space Invaders is a game created using Python

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter game in which the player controls a spaceship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen.

The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the missiles. As more aliens are defeated, the game complexity increases. For every 25 points scored, aliens count increases by 1. Defeating the aliens is not possible as it is a loop which can continue endlessly. You need to score as much points as you can.

If any of the alien reached the bottom, the alien invasion is declared successful and the game ends tragically.
